## Notes:
- Coil is utilized to efficiently load and cache images.
- Configuration changes are seamlessly handled.
- You might have noticed a slight issue with the map mask. This occurred due to an error during the export process from Figma. As a workaround, I utilized some free online resources to create the mask.
